KEYLOGGER PROGRAM

This project was developed as part of my cybersecurity internship with Prodigy Infotech. It is a basic keylogger that records keystrokes and logs them into a file for educational and awareness purposes.

Disclaimer: 

This tool was built strictly for learning as part of my internship.

Keyloggers can be misused for malicious purposes but here, the aim is to understand how attackers think so we can build better defenses.

FEATURES

✅ Captures all keystrokes

✅ Logs them into a file

✅ Runs in the background

✅ Simple and lightweight

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python 3

pynput library (for keyboard event handling)

HOW IT WORKS 

The program listens for keyboard events.

Each key pressed is captured.

The keystrokes are saved into a log file for later review.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

When typing:

Hello World


The log file may contain:

['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']

SKILLS GAINED

Understanding keystroke logging techniques

Learning about input event handling in Python

Awareness of offensive cybersecurity tools

Building knowledge to develop defensive strategies
